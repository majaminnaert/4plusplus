# 4plusplus (Lines 1-15)
4++ is devoted to making creative solutions for your intelligence needs! With 4++ you'll always have the most
awesome ideas at your fingertips!

## Works in Progress
We are currently working on technology that will greatly expand on the current functionality for working
together as a team over the internet. It will allow co-workers to share coffee with each other over the
internet, which we believe is key to fun and productive remote teamwork. After all, coffee is what keeps
us going, right? We suspect further features will include tea, real edible cookies and pie.

## Achievements
We are a young team, and are happy to throw in our enthusiasm to achieve our first priority, enabling teams
all over the world to share coffee while working remotely.

### Aspirations after BeCode
I'm super excited to be part of BeCode and of the intriguing world of AI and data science. After taking the BeCode 
training, I hope to find a job that gives me a good deal of daily challenges and much more to learn about, whether in terms
of the technology or in terms of what we will use our data and AI skills for. I will probably combine the job with more in
depth learning, maybe at a university even. Another dream I hope may come through is moving to Berlin for a number of 
years, because it is a very inspiring city. I also look forward very much to exploring the possibilities of crossing 
technology and arts.
